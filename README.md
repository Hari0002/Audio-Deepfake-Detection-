# Audio Deepfake Detection with ResNet-18

A lightweight and efficient solution for detecting AI-generated synthetic speech using **ResNet-18** trained on log-mel spectrograms. Designed for simplicity, speed, and ease of deployment.

## üîç Overview  
This repository implements a ResNet-18-based model to classify audio clips as **real** or **fake**. The model processes log-mel spectrograms of audio signals to detect artifacts introduced by AI-based voice synthesis (e.g., TTS, voice conversion).

## üöÄ Key Features  
- **Lightweight Model**: ResNet-18 (11.7M parameters) ensures fast inference (~50 ms/clip on CPU).  
- **Log-Mel Spectrograms**: Extracts time-frequency features for robust artifact detection.  
- **Pre-trained Weights**: Leverages ImageNet initialization for faster convergence.  
- **Real-Time Ready**: Optimized for deployment on edge devices.
